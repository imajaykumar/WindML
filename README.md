# WindML
• Wind energy prediction represents an important and active field in the renewable energy sector. Since renewable energy sources are integrated into existing grids and combined with traditional sources,knowing the amount of energy that will be produced is key in minimizing the operational cost of the wind
farm and safe operation of the power grid.

• To create windmill Power Prediction using machine learning and deploy in the cloud environment.

• It will help wind farm owners to plan the scheduling and electricity trades to maximize their profit.

DATASET COLLECTION

• Collected the dataset from Kaggle

DATA CLEANING

• The raw data cannot be used to train the model so pre-processing of the data is mandatory to train the model

MODELLING AND TUNING THE MODEL

• Used Lasso regression which is a type of linear regression that uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk
towards a central point, like the mean. The lasso procedure encourages simple, sparse models (i.e. models with fewer
parameters).The acronym “LASSO” stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and saved the model as
lasso.pkl

DEPLOYMENT

• Need to create a framework to use the model and before the deployment, used Streamlit is an open-source app
framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. Create beautiful data apps.

• Uploaded the whole code in github for version control later we deployed in the Heroku which is a Heroku is a platform as a
service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
